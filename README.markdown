# Third Eye

Third Eye is a decentralized autonomous emergency response system. Communities/government can run the system to progressively automate their emergency response system.

## Vision

TE will be open source, federated & will have transparent policies so that any community/government can easily adopt it.

## Status

The system is being developed, we will soon do a soft release with PoC to get wider support.

## Inspiration

We got the idea after implementing a bare bones tracking system for a Hackathon & meeting the authorities after winning it. It became clear how inefficient is the current system & how much improvement is possible with the readily available technologies.
